# LootLogger
This is the example app from the Chapter 9 Big Nerd Ranch 7th edition textbook (2020) but with my notes
In an attempt to make the app simpler, I made the following changes from the textbook
- skipped @discardableResult (Listing 9.6)
- skipped reusing cells (Listing 9.12)
- skipped checking size of table (Listing 9.15)
- skipped the Item equality method (Listing 9.17)
